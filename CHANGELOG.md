[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Workspace scaffold with `yip-io`, `yip-wire`, `yip-crypto`, `yip-transport`,
  `yip-device`, and `yipd` crate stubs.
- CI quality gates: build, test, clippy, rustfmt, cargo-shear, cargo-deny,
  coverage, and mutation testing.
- Pre-commit hooks (file hygiene, cargo fmt, clippy, and test).
- Public `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- `yip-wire` frame codec: header serialization, SipHash coverage-auth tag, and
  keyed header protection, with fuzzing of the deframe path.
- `yip-crypto` Noise-IK handshake (via `snow`) and AEAD `Session` with explicit
  per-frame nonces and a sliding anti-replay window.
- `yip-device` TUN (L3) and TAP (L2) tunnel devices, and `yip-io` io_uring
  DataPlaneIo backend with a portable plain-socket fallback.
- `yip-transport` adaptive RaptorQ FEC: per-flow classifier, object encoder,
  pipelined erasure-tolerant reassembler, and a repair-ratio controller.
- `yip-transport` stateful flow-table heuristic: classifies unmarked flows by
  observed packet size/rate, completing the policy -> DSCP -> heuristic -> default
  precedence chain.
- `yipd` end-to-end tunnel: Noise handshake over UDP, session-derived wire keys,
  and L3 (TUN) traffic tunneled through the encrypted adaptive-FEC transport
  between two static peers (ping-tested across network namespaces).
- `yip-bench`: hot-path micro-benchmarks (AEAD, wire framing, RaptorQ FEC encode)
  via Criterion, and a `tc netem` latency/loss harness comparing the yip tunnel
  against kernel WireGuard (results in `crates/yip-bench/README.md`).
