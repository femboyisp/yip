# Milestone 4a: Throughput — Small-K Reed–Solomon Codec — Design Spec

**Status:** draft (under review)
**Sub-project:** #4 (Throughput & Scalability), milestone 4a.
**Supersedes:** `2026-07-09-throughput-plan-cached-fec-4a-design.md` (plan-cached RaptorQ — abandoned; see §2).

---

## 1. Goal

Replace RaptorQ with a hand-rolled small-K **systematic Reed–Solomon** codec in yip's
per-packet FEC (`crates/yip-transport/src/fec.rs`), eliminating RaptorQ's fixed
per-object cost and unlocking **multi-gigabit single-core throughput while keeping
proactive FEC** (zero-RTT loss recovery). In the same milestone, build the reusable
**GF(256) arithmetic core** that the whole FEC-codec campaign (RS → sliding-window RLC →
RLNC recoding) rides on.

## 2. Why — the investigation that led here

A profiling spike and a four-track investigation established the following ground truth
(all measured, release builds, symbol_size 1200):

- yip FEC-encodes **per packet**: objects are 1–3 source symbols (K≈2), repair R≈1.
- RaptorQ encode is ~26 µs/packet → the ~355 Mbit/s single-core ceiling.
- **Caching RaptorQ's `SourceBlockEncodingPlan` only reaches ~12 µs** (2.1×), and 96% of
  that residual is the irreducible GF(256) intermediate-symbol solve over RaptorQ's
  **K′=10 minimum block** (RFC 6330 systematic table). A 2-symbol object does ~10
  symbols of work — a ~5× padding tax that no implementation avoids.
- The K′=10 tax exists because RaptorQ is a **rateless fountain code**. yip **never uses
  ratelessness**: `AdaptiveController::observe_loss` clamps `ratio ≤ 1.0`, so
  `repair_count(source) ≤ source` always — never near a fountain code's unbounded repair.
  yip pays RaptorQ's biggest cost for a capability it does not use.
- **Small-K systematic Reed–Solomon**, measured: **0.77 µs encode / 0.89 µs decode** at
  K=2/R=1 (`reed-solomon-erasure`), and **0.06 µs** for the R=1 XOR-parity case — ~15×
  faster than plan-cached RaptorQ, same byte overhead (R/K), no `unsafe`, and its 255−K
  on-demand repair ceiling is never binding for yip's R values.

RS keeps per-packet framing (no batching latency) and proactive repair (zero-RTT
recovery), so it gives up nothing yip actually uses. The RaptorQ dependency is dropped.

> **Campaign context.** 4a is **Stage 1** of a staged FEC-codec campaign toward the
> north-star of **sliding-window RLNC**: Stage 2 (RLC, RFC 8681) kills the residual
> bandwidth overhead and adds streaming recovery; Stage 3 adds relay recoding for the
> mesh. All three are GF(256) linear codes — 4a builds the GF(256) core and the erasure
> Gaussian-elimination solver that Stage 2 reuses verbatim, and 4a's wire framing
> pre-slots the later codecs via a codec tag (§6).

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 The GF(256) core (`crates/yip-transport/src/gf256.rs`, new)

A small, safe, table-based GF(256) engine — the reusable foundation:

- Field: GF(2⁸) with reducing polynomial `0x11D` (`x⁸+x⁴+x³+x²+1`).
- Precomputed `LOG`/`EXP` tables (512-entry EXP to avoid modular reduction on multiply).
- Public ops: `add(a,b) = a ^ b`; `mul(a,b)` via log/antilog; `mul_slice_into(dst, src, c)`
  = multiply-accumulate `dst[i] ^= mul(src[i], c)` (the symbol-wise MAC used by both
  RS repair generation and the decoder).
- The new `gf256.rs` carries its own `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` (no SIMD in 4a; a future SIMD
  path can live in a leaf crate if profiling ever demands it — not needed to hit
  multi-gigabit, per the model).

Tables are built once at first use (`std::sync::OnceLock`), not per encode.

### 3.2 Encoder (`FecEncoder`, rewritten)

Systematic RS over the GF(256) core. For an object of `object_size` bytes:

1. `K = ceil(object_size / symbol_size)` source symbols of `symbol_size` bytes (final
   symbol zero-padded to the boundary).
2. **Reject** `K == 0` (empty ciphertext — impossible for a sealed AEAD frame, but guarded)
   and `K ≥ 255` (no room for a repair symbol in GF(256); unreachable at `symbol_size` 1200
   where `K ≤ ceil(256 KiB / 1200) = 219`, but guards a future smaller `symbol_size`). Then
   `R = min(repair_count, 255 − K)` repair symbols (the clamp is the GF(256) codeword bound;
   never binding at yip's per-packet `K`, documented for the future coalesced case).
3. Generate repair with **one consistent generator** for all R: repair symbol at
   `symbol_index = K + m` (`m = 0..R−1`) is `repair_m[b] = Σ_i C[m][i] · source_i[b]` over
   GF(256), where `C` is the `R×K` **Cauchy** matrix. Repair row `m` depends only on
   `(K, m)` — never on R — so a given repair index always means the same linear
   combination regardless of how many repair symbols were emitted. **This consistency is
   load-bearing:** the decoder derives K from `object_size` and reconstructs the row for
   each *received* repair index directly, without needing to know R (R is not on the wire).
4. Emit `K + R` `Symbol`s: source symbols at `symbol_index` `0..K−1` (raw data —
   **systematic**, so a no-loss receiver does zero decode work), repair symbols at
   `K..K+R−1`.

> **On the XOR micro-opt (deferred).** For R=1 a plain XOR parity encodes in ~0.06 µs vs
> ~0.77 µs for the general Cauchy path — but XOR is the *all-ones* row, which is **not**
> Cauchy row 0, so using it for R=1 while using Cauchy for R≥2 would make repair index K
> ambiguous to the decoder. Since FEC at 0.77 µs is already far below the AEAD floor
> (~2 µs) — i.e. no longer the bottleneck — 4a uses the single consistent Cauchy generator
> and does **not** special-case R=1. A future micro-opt could adopt a RAID-6-style
> all-ones-P + Vandermonde-Q generator (MDS for R≤2, XOR-fast for the P symbol) if ever
> warranted; out of scope for 4a.

`repair_with_id(object_id, extra_repair)` (the ARQ retransmit path) **re-encodes the whole
object** under the given `object_id`: it emits all `K` source symbols (indices `0..K−1`)
plus `extra_repair` repair symbols (indices `K..K+extra_repair−1`), using the **same Cauchy
rows** as proactive `encode`, clamped so `K + extra_repair ≤ 255`. This preserves the
existing contract — a receiver that got *zero* original symbols reconstructs from the ARQ
batch alone — and needs **no per-object repair-count state**: repair row `m` is a pure
function of `(K, m)`, so re-emitting indices `K..` reproduces byte-identical repair symbols.
The decoder is **index-idempotent** (a repair index it already holds is dropped as a
duplicate), so overlap between the proactive and ARQ batches is harmless.

**Generator = Cauchy, not Vandermonde.** The load-bearing property is **MDS**: any K of the
K+R shards must decode. A Cauchy matrix over GF(256) guarantees every K×K submatrix is
invertible by construction (Vandermonde can be singular for some K/index combinations).
The systematic generator is conceptually `[ I_K ; C ]` (identity rows = source, Cauchy
rows = repair). The `R×K` Cauchy matrix is cached per `K` (working set is K=1–3; bounded
at 64 entries like the prior plan cache, cleared on overflow).

### 3.2.1 Normative Cauchy generator (RS v1)

Codec tag `0x01` **binds this exact construction** — every conforming implementation MUST
produce identical repair symbols, or the wire meaning is undefined. Over GF(256) (poly
`0x11D`):

- Source-column elements: `y_i = i` for `i ∈ 0..K−1`.
- Repair-row elements: `x_m = K + m` for `m ∈ 0..R−1`.
- Cauchy entry: `C[m][i] = inv(x_m ⊕ y_i)`, where `⊕` is GF(256) addition (XOR) and `inv`
  is the GF(256) multiplicative inverse.
- `repair_m[b] = Σ_{i=0}^{K−1} C[m][i] · source_i[b]` for each byte `b`.
- Source rows are identity (systematic): source symbol `i` is emitted verbatim at
  `symbol_index = i`; repair symbol `m` at `symbol_index = K + m`.

The sets `{y_i} = {0..K−1}` and `{x_m} = {K..K+R−1}` are disjoint and distinct (guaranteed
by `K + R ≤ 255`), so every `x_m ⊕ y_i ≠ 0` and every K×K submatrix of `[ I_K ; C ]` is
invertible — the code is **MDS**. Repair row `m` depends only on `(K, m)`, never on R.

### 3.3 Reassembler (`FecReassembler`, rewritten)

- Group received symbols by `object_id`; record each arrived `symbol_index` and its bytes.
- `K = ceil(object_size / symbol_size)` (from `object_size`, as today).
- **All K source indices (`0..K−1`) present →** concatenate source symbols, trim to
  `object_size`. No decode (systematic passthrough — the no-loss common case).
- **Else, once ≥ K distinct shards arrived →** erasure-decode: form the K×K submatrix of
  `[ I_K ; C ]` for the K received indices, invert it via Gaussian elimination over
  GF(256), multiply by the received shards to recover the missing source symbols, trim to
  `object_size`.
- Return the reconstructed object exactly once; later/duplicate symbols for a completed
  object return `None`.

**DoS guards (preserved from the RaptorQ reassembler, plus RS-specific bounds):**
- reject `object_size == 0` or `object_size > MAX_OBJECT_SIZE` (256 KiB), and the derived
  `K == 0` or `K ≥ 255`;
- reject a wrong codec tag (`payload_id[0] ≠ 0x01`) and `symbol_index ≥ 255` (out of the
  GF(256) codeword range — the analogue of the current SBN-bounds guard);
- **dedupe by `symbol_index`** (a repeated index is ignored, not buffered) and **decode and
  free as soon as `K` distinct shards arrive**, so at most `K` shards are ever buffered per
  object — an attacker cannot inflate storage beyond one object's `K`;
- bound objects-in-flight with oldest-object eviction (`max_objects`);
- never panic on any attacker-supplied field — return `None`.

## 4. Public API (unchanged shape — callers in `lib.rs` untouched)

- `FecEncoder::encode(&mut self, ciphertext: &[u8], params: FlowParams, repair: u32) -> Vec<Symbol>`
- `FecEncoder::repair_with_id(&mut self, ciphertext: &[u8], params: FlowParams, object_id: u16, extra_repair: u32) -> Vec<Symbol>`
- `FecReassembler::new(symbol_size: u16, max_objects: usize)` / `push(&mut self, &Symbol) -> Option<Vec<u8>>`
- `Symbol { object_id: u16, object_size: u32, payload_id: [u8;4], data: Vec<u8> }` — struct
  shape unchanged; `payload_id` semantics change (§6).

`Transport::encode`/`decode`/`repair_object` and `AdaptiveController` are
**behavior-preserving**: the `repair_count → R` derivation is identical and only the encoder
clamps `R ≤ 255 − K`. Doc comments that still reference "RaptorQ" are updated to "FEC repair
symbols" (§8).

## 5. Invariants

1. **MDS correctness:** any K of the K+R emitted shards reconstruct the object
   byte-for-byte, for every K∈{1,2,3,8} and R∈{1,2,4} exercised by tests (the per-packet
   MTU path is K≈1–3; K=8 stresses the future coalesced-object path).
2. **Systematic:** with no loss, the decoder does zero field arithmetic (source symbols
   are the raw data); output equals the original ciphertext exactly.
3. **No behavior/policy change:** all flow-class repair ratios (Realtime 0.15, Default
   0.10, Bulk 0.05) and the adaptive controller are unchanged; byte overhead stays R/K.
4. **Codeword bound:** `K + R ≤ 255` always (encoder clamp).
5. **No panics on malformed input;** all existing DoS guards hold.
6. **`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`** holds across `yip-transport`.

## 6. Wire framing

The `yip-wire::Frame` structure is **unchanged**. Only the meaning of the opaque
`payload_id: [u8;4]` changes, plus a codec tag. Layout is
**`[tag:u8][index:u16 big-endian][reserved:u8]`** (byte 0 = tag, bytes 1–2 = index, byte 3
reserved):

- `payload_id[0] = codec_tag` — `0x01` = "RS v1". Turns the RaptorQ→RS interop break into
  an explicit, detectable mismatch, and pre-slots RLC as `0x02`.
- `payload_id[1..=2] = symbol_index: u16` (big-endian) — the shard position: `0..K−1`
  source, `K..K+R−1` repair.
- `payload_id[3]` = reserved (0) — headroom for RLC window metadata later.
- `object_size` continues to ride in the frame payload prefix and yields
  `K = ceil(object_size / symbol_size)`; `object_id`, `flags`, `counter` unchanged.

**Responsibility split (`wire_glue.rs` is unchanged):** `FecEncoder` *packs* `payload_id`
= `[0x01, idx_hi, idx_lo, 0]` when it emits a `Symbol`; `FecReassembler` *validates* the
codec tag and *parses* `symbol_index` on receive. `wire_glue.rs::symbol_to_frame` /
`frame_to_symbol` already pass `Symbol.payload_id` through the `Frame` verbatim and need no
change.

**Interop:** wire-incompatible with RaptorQ peers. Fails **safe** — an RS decoder rejects a
non-`0x01` codec tag rather than misdecoding. Acceptable under yip's pre-release
"both peers rebuild together" posture; the codec tag makes the change (and the future RLC
change) detectable rather than silent. FEC framing rides *inside* the encrypted/obfuscated
envelope (3a `obf_psk` / 3c.1 QUIC), so the change creates **no new DPI signature**.

## 7. Testing & verification

- **GF(256) unit tests:** field axioms (commutativity, associativity, distributivity,
  `a·a⁻¹ = 1` for all a≠0) against a brute-force carryless-multiply reference.
- **RS round-trip property test (the correctness gate):** for K∈{1,2,3,8}, R∈{1,2,4},
  encode a known payload, then for **every** K-of-(K+R) subset of shards, assert the
  reassembler reconstructs the original byte-for-byte. Exhaustive over erasure patterns —
  this *is* the MDS proof for yip's K/R range.
- **Systematic no-loss test:** all K source shards → reconstruct with zero decode path taken.
- **Independent cross-check (dropped):** an earlier revision used `reed-solomon-erasure` as
  a dev-dependency oracle, but it transitively pulls the unmaintained `instant` crate
  (RUSTSEC-2024-0384), which fails the repo's `cargo-deny` advisories gate. Removed — the
  exhaustive K-of-(K+R) MDS property test above is a complete, self-contained proof for
  yip's K/R range and needs no external oracle.
- **DoS/malformed tests:** port the existing guard tests (zero/oversized `object_size`,
  out-of-range `symbol_index`, late/duplicate symbol, eviction-at-capacity) to the RS
  reassembler, plus new guards: `K == 0`/`K ≥ 255`, wrong codec tag, duplicate-index dedupe.
- **`payload_id` pack/parse test:** `FecEncoder` packs `[0x01, idx_hi, idx_lo, 0]`;
  `FecReassembler` round-trips the `symbol_index` and rejects a non-`0x01` tag. (`wire_glue`
  is unchanged, so no new wire_glue test is required.)
- **Benchmarks:** `hotpath::transport_encode_1300` and `pipeline_profile` → encode <1 µs;
  record before/after + single-core multi-gigabit projection in `crates/yip-bench/RESULTS.md`.
- **No-regression (end-to-end gate):** netns loss paths `run-netns-tunnel-loss.sh` (FEC
  recovers dropped packets across a real tunnel) and `run-arq-integrity.sh` (retransmit via
  `repair_with_id`), plus the clean `run-netns-tunnel.sh` / `-l2` tests. Green here proves
  the swap end-to-end. If the environment cannot run netns/sudo, the exhaustive round-trip
  property test is the correctness guarantee.

## 8. Scope & files

- **Create:** `crates/yip-transport/src/gf256.rs` (GF(256) core), `rs.rs` *optional* if the
  RS matrix/codec logic is cleaner split from `fec.rs` — otherwise keep it in `fec.rs`.
- **Rewrite:** `crates/yip-transport/src/fec.rs` (`FecEncoder`, `FecReassembler`, `Symbol`
  framing; RaptorQ-specific code removed; new unit tests replacing the RaptorQ ones).
- **Modify:** `crates/yip-transport/src/lib.rs` (register `gf256` module; `pub mod`);
  `crates/yip-transport/Cargo.toml` (drop `raptorq` runtime dep; add `reed-solomon-erasure`
  dev-dep); `crates/yip-bench` benches/examples/`Cargo.toml` that reference `raptorq`;
  `RESULTS.md`. Update FEC doc comments that say "RaptorQ" (incl. `Transport::repair_object`)
  to "FEC repair symbols" (behavior-preserving).
- **Untouched:** `bin/yipd/src/wire_glue.rs` (passes `payload_id` through verbatim — packing
  and validation live in `FecEncoder`/`FecReassembler`); `yip-wire::Frame` structure;
  `control.rs` logic; the QUIC path; `AdaptiveController`.
- **Housekeeping:** the superseded plan-cache spec/plan get a "superseded" banner; the
  `plan_cache_spike.rs` throwaway example is removed.

**Milestone numbering.** The throughput sub-project keeps `4a` = RS codec, `4b` = I/O
batching, `4c` = multi-core sharding. The FEC-codec campaign stages beyond RS —
sliding-window RLC (Stage 2), RLNC recoding (Stage 3) — are their own milestones on that
track and do **not** renumber `4b`/`4c`. (4a is simultaneously throughput-lever #1 and
codec-campaign Stage 1.)

**Follow-up doc debt (not 4a code, tracked separately):** `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, and
`docs/research` still name RaptorQ as the FEC primary; a follow-up doc pass must update them
so future work doesn't reintroduce RaptorQ. The RaptorQ-centric FEC object-batching design
note becomes "unnecessary for CPU after RS, still relevant to the small-K bandwidth floor
that Stage 2 RLC addresses."

**Out of scope (later milestones):** sliding-window RLC (Stage 2), RLNC recoding (Stage 3),
I/O batching (4b), multi-core sharding (4c), AEAD acceleration.
